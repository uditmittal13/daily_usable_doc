MongoDB CE (Community Edition)
MongoDB Community Edition is the free, open-source version of MongoDB that you can install and manage yourself.

MongoDB Community Edition – Key Points
✅ Free to use
✅ Self-managed (you run, secure, monitor, and back it up)
❌ No enterprise features
❌ No official MongoDB support or SLA

What CE Includes
Core MongoDB database
Replica Sets
Sharding
WiredTiger storage engine
SCRAM authentication
TLS (manual setup)

What CE Does NOT Include
LDAP / Active Directory integration
Native encryption at rest
Advanced auditing
Ops Manager (backup & monitoring)
Enterprise support

What is MongoDB Atlas?
MongoDB Atlas is MongoDB’s fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) provided by MongoDB itself.
👉 Think of Atlas = MongoDB managed by MongoDB
👉 While CE / EE = MongoDB managed by you

In Simple Terms
Term			Meaning
CE				Community Edition – self-managed, free
EE				Enterprise Edition – self-managed, paid
Atlas			Fully managed MongoDB service

What Atlas Provides (Out of the Box)
You do NOT manage:
Server provisioning
MongoDB installation
Upgrades & patching
Backups & restores
Monitoring & alerts
Failover & scaling
Security hardening
MongoDB handles everything


Ques.. Diff B/w Atlas v/s  ( CE/EE)
				Atlas 	vs 		Self-Managed (CE / EE)
Area			Atlas			CE / EE
Management		MongoDB			Your team
Upgrades		Automatic		Manual
Backups			Built-in		Manual / Ops Manager
Monitoring		Built-in		External
SLA				Yes				No (CE)
Cost			Subscription	Infra + Ops cost



## MongoDB Community Edition fully supports Standalone, Replica Set, and Sharded Cluster deployment types.
Also, Sharded Cluster (Large Scale / High Throughput) Includes:
mongos routers
Config servers (replica set)
Shard replica sets
Horizontal scaling

Typical Usage:-
Very large datasets
High write throughput
Large concurrent users

### Recommendation (Real-World) with respect to CE Edition
Use Case	Best Choice (CE)
Dev / POC	Standalone
Production (most apps)	Replica Set (3 nodes)
Very high scale	Sharded (with caution)


### Is vertical scaling available in CE Edition.
Yes — vertical scaling is available in MongoDB Community Edition, but it is manual, not automatic.
Let me explain clearly 👇

What is Vertical Scaling?
Vertical scaling = increase resources of a node
More CPU
More RAM
More Disk / IOPS

MongoDB CE does not restrict vertical scaling. You can:
Increase VM size
Increase Kubernetes pod CPU / memory
Expand disk size
Move to faster storage (SSD → NVMe)

####Is Horizontal scaling available in CE Edition ?
Yes — horizontal scaling is available in MongoDB Community Edition (CE), but again it is manual, not automated.
Let’s make it very clear 👇
What is Horizontal Scaling?
Horizontal scaling = add more nodes
More replica set members (for HA/read scale)  > Known as Replica Set scaling
More shards (for write & data scale)          > Sarded Cluster Scaling
