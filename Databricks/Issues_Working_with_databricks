While working with Databricks, I noticed that most issues don’t come from Spark itself but from how Databricks is used.

Here are some common Databricks mistakes data engineers make — and how to fix them.

Mistake 1: Using all-purpose clusters for scheduled jobs
Solution: Use job clusters with auto-termination for better isolation and lower cost.

Mistake 2: Ignoring auto-termination settings
Solution: Always configure aggressive auto-termination to avoid paying for idle clusters.

Mistake 3: Treating Delta tables like plain Parquet
Solution: Leverage Delta Lake features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel.

Mistake 4: Poor file sizing and partitioning strategy
Solution: Optimize file sizes (e.g., 128–512 MB) and partition only on high-cardinality access patterns.

Mistake 5: No idempotency or retry logic
Solution: Design pipelines to be re-runnable using merge logic, checkpoints, or overwrite-by-partition.

Mistake 6: Missing monitoring and alerting
Solution: Use job alerts, logs, and metrics so failures are caught by systems—not users.

Key takeaway:
Databricks is easy to start with, but production-grade pipelines require architectural discipline, not just Spark code.
