k edit cm kubevip -n kube-system 
kubectl edit configmap kubevip -n kube-system

Elaborate:-
kubectl- The Kubernetes CLI tool. Used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server
edit - Allows you to modify a Kubernetes object directly
cm - stands for configmap. ConfigMaps store: Configuration values ,Environment variables ,App settings (like kube-vip behavior)
kubevip -  Name of the ConfigMap. Typically used by kube-vip to store settings such as: VIP address ,  Interface name ,ARP / BGP mode ,Control-plane or service mode.
-n kubesystem - specifies the namespace , kube-system is reserved for: Core Kubernetes components , Networking, DNS, CNI, kube-vip, etc

Understanding:-

Ques:- What is kube-vip?
kube-vip is a lightweight Kubernetes component that provides Virtual IPs (VIPs) for:
Highly Available Kubernetes control plane
LoadBalancer-type Services (without cloud providers)
It works inside the cluster, usually as a DaemonSet or static Pod, and avoids external load balancers.

Ques:-  Why kube-vip exists (the problem it solves)
1️. Control Plane High Availability
   Without kube-vip:
		kube-apiserver runs on multiple masters
		But clients (kubectl, kubelets) need one stable endpoint
   With kube-vip:
		A single virtual IP (VIP) floats between control-plane nodes
		If the active master goes down → VIP moves automaticall
2️. LoadBalancer Services on Bare Metal
	In cloud:
	Service type: LoadBalancer → cloud creates LB automatically
	On bare metal:
	Kubernetes has no built-in LB
	kube-vip:
	Assigns a VIP per LoadBalancer Service
	Advertises it on the network
	Routes traffic to backend pods

So what does “LoadBalancer Services on Bare Metal” mean??
Ans. it means: Providing LoadBalancer functionality WITHOUT a cloud provider.( Tools like: kube-vip ,MetalLB fill this gap.)

Note:- Bare metal Kubernetes means running Kubernetes without a cloud provider, so LoadBalancer services must be implemented using tools like kube-vip or MetalLB.
	   Bare metal means Kubernetes is running directly on physical servers (or plain VMs) with NO cloud provider integration.

Ques VIP advertisement methods
	kube-vip can advertise IPs using:
		ARP (Layer 2) → most common  ( ARP- Address resolution protocol)
		BGP (Layer 3) → for advanced networks
		
Bare metal vs Cloud (core difference)
| Aspect                 | Cloud Kubernetes  | Bare Metal Kubernetes         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Infrastructure         | AWS / Azure / GCP | Physical servers / private DC |
| LoadBalancer creation  | Automatic         | ❌ Not available               |
| Cloud Controller       | Present           | ❌ Absent                      |
| External IP assignment | Automatic         | ❌ Manual                      |
| Example                | EKS, AKS, GKE     | kubeadm on servers            |
		

Ques:- How kube-vip helps on Bare Metal ??
	kube-vip:
	step1. Assigns a Virtual IP (VIP) from your local network
	step2. Advertises it using ARP or BGP
	step3. Routes traffic to Kubernetes pods

#### Kube-vip Configmap  ####
A kube-vip ConfigMap is a Kubernetes configuration file located in the kube-system namespace, utilized by the kube-vip-cloud-provider to manage IP address pools for LoadBalancer services in bare-metal or on-premises environments. 
It defines the range of IP addresses (via CIDR blocks or ranges) that kube-vip assigns to Kubernetes services, enabling automatic IP address management without external cloud providers. 

Key Aspects of the kube-vip ConfigMap:
Purpose:       The kube-vip-cloud-provider reads this map to assign IP addresses to services of type LoadBalancer.
Location:      Usually stored in kube-system to allow the cloud controller manager to monitor it.
Content:       Defines CIDR ranges, multiple pools, or specific IP ranges, including support for mixed IP families (IPv4/IPv6).
Configuration: The cloud provider is pointed to this map using environment variables (KUBEVIP_CONFIG_MAP). 


Sample kube-vip configmap yaml file 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevip
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  allow-share-global: true
  cidr-default: 192.168.0.200/29
  cidr-plunder: 192.168.0.210/29
  allow-share-plunder: false
  cidr-testing: 192.168.0.220/29
